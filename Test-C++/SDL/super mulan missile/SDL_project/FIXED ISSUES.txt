Fixed memory leaking in "inline void game::mouse_eve()".

Commented 100ms delays after clicking mouse.

Added member "color" to the Initializing list of "ball::ball()".

Added a initializer "ball::pos(double _x = 0, double _y = 0)".

Rewrote "double* ball::get_pos()" to "typename ball::pos ball::get_pos()"
  because the previous return value is invalid
  (return a address of a array that will be deleted when exits the function).

Rewrote part of "inline void game::con_key_eve()",
  "inline void game::mouse_eve()",
  and "void mlm::single_twin_update(double V,int num)"
  that related with "pos ball::get_pos()".

Added "typedef ball::pos pos" to "src\game.cpp"

Added members "pWindow", "pRenderer", "mlm_eve", "StartingTime", "EndingTime",
  "ElapsedMicroseconds", "Frequency" to the Initializing list of "ball::ball()"
  and rearranged the order.

Overrode "game::game(game const &)"
  and "game::game &operator=(game const &)"
  to private.

Overrode "mulan_missle::mulan_missle(mulan_missle const &_val)"
  and "mulan_missle &mulan_missle::operator=(mulan_missle const &_val)"
  to avoid accessing deleted "ball* twins".

Renamed the names of the parameters of "mulan_missle::mulan_missle(double x,double y)"
  to "double _x, double _y" to avoid shadowing issue.

Added members "mass_heart", "vec", "twins", tw_v"
  to the Initializing list of "mulan_missle::mulan_missle(double _x, double _y)"

Rewrote "mulan_missle::mulan_missle(double _x, double _y)"
  and "mulan_missle::mulan_missle()".

Renamed the names of the parameters of "bool mlm::is_out_of_boarder(int x,int y)"
  to "int _x, int _y" to avoid shadowing issue.
